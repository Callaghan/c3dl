        <p>
            This page tests to make sure that the near and far clipping planes are not allowed to overlap.  Pressing q will cause the near clipping plane to move farther away, while a will bring it closer. Pressing w will move the far clipping plane farther away, with s bringing it closer.  Prior to this change you could move the near clipping plane beyond the far plane, enabling you to see objects between them.  You should no longer be able to cause either of the planes to move past the other.

        <p>
            This page tests to make sure that the near and far clipping planes<br />
            are not allowed to overlap.  Pressing q will cause the near clipping<br />
            plane ot move farther awqy, while a will bring it closer. Pressing w<br />
            will move the far clipping plane farther away, with s bringing it<br />
            closer.  Prior to this change you could move the near clipping<br />
            plane beyond the far plane, enabling you to see objects between<br />
            them.  You should no longer be able to cause either of the planes<br />
            to move past the other.<br />
